:snake: Python math drills on the command-line!

Without any additional command-line arguments, the program will randomly switch between addition, subtraction, and time-telling problems. To drill only these problems, they can be specified by `-a`, `-m`, and `-t` respectively. Each of these problems earn varying points, depending on difficulty.

The program will quit automatically upon earning 30 points, or you can quit manually with <kbd>Ctrl C</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl D</kbd>
